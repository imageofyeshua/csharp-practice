our Father in heaven
sanctified be Thy Name
Thy kingdom come
Thy will be done on earth
as it is in heaven
give us this day our daily bread
and forgive us our iniquities
as we also forgive others' iniquities
do not lead us into temptations
but deliver us from evil
for Thine is the kingdom
and power and glory forever.
Amen
