love is patient
love is kind
it does not envy
it does not brag
it is not puffed up
it does not behave inappropriately
it does not seek its own way
it is not provoked
it keeps no account of wrong
it does not rejoice over injustice
but rejoices in the truth
it bears all things
it believes all things
it hopes all things
it endures all things
love never fails...
